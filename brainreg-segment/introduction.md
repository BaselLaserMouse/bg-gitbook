# Introduction

brainreg-segment is a companion to [brainreg](../brainreg/introduction.md) allowing manual segmentation of regions/objects within the brain \(e.g. injection sites, probes etc.\) allowing for automated analysis of brain region distribution, and visualisation \(e.g. in [brainrender](https://github.com/BrancoLab/brainrender)\).

### Installation

brainreg-segment comes bundled with brainreg, so see the [brainreg installation instructions](../brainreg/installation.md). brainreg-segment can be installed on it's own \(`pip install brainreg-segment`\), but you will need to register your data with brainreg first. 

### Usage

See [User guide](user-guide.md).
