# Introduction

brainreg-seg is a companion to [brainreg](../brainreg/introduction.md) allowing manual segmentation of regions/objects within the brain \(e.g. injection sites, probes etc.\) allowing for automated analysis of brain region distribution, and visualisation \(e.g. in [brainrender](https://github.com/BrancoLab/brainrender)\).
