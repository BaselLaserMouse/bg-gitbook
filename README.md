# About

## Introduction

BrainGlobe is a project from the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and the [Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology](https://www.neuro.mpg.de/en) to develop open software tools in Python for the exploration, visualisation and analysis of neuronal morphology data, from single neurons to whole brains.

## BrainGlobe project

### Brain atlases

One of the most important parts of the BrainGlobe project is dealing with varied atlases from multiple species.

Central to this is the the BrainGlobe atlas API \([BG-AtlasAPI](bg-atlasapi/introduction.md)\) which provides a common interface to process data from different atlases, originally defined in different ways.

{% hint style="info" %}
In BrainGlobe, an atlas is defined as a collection of files, including, but not limited to:

* An image of a brain \(reference\)
* A corresponding image with individual brain regions defined by pixel value \(annotation\)
* Metadata defining properties of the atlas
