description: About the brainreg plugin for napari

# Introduction

brainreg is software for the registration of whole-brain microscopy datasets to a reference atlas. This allows the brain to be segmented into individual regions based on the atlas, and for all data to be warped to a common anatomical reference frame.

To simplify use, we have created a plugin for [napari](https://napari.org/), so that brainreg can be installed and used without touching the command line. 

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is about the plugin specifically, for more details about brainreg more generally, see the [main page](../brainreg/introduction.md).

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

First [install napari](https://napari.org/#installation). You can then install the plugin from within napari \(`Plugins` -&gt; `Install/Uninstall Package(s)`, choosing `brainreg-napari`\).

N.B. brainreg is only fully supported on Windows and Linux \(i.e. not macOS\)
