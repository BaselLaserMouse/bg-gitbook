# BG-Space

Working with anatomical images, one often encounters the problem of matching the orientation of stacks with different conventions about axes orientation and order. Moreover, when multiple swaps and flips are involved, it can be annoying to map the same transformations to volumes and points \(e.g., coordinates or meshes\).

`bg-space` provides a neat way of defining an anatomical space, and of operating stacks and point transformations between spaces.

## Installation

You can install `bg-space` with:

```text
pip install bg-space
```
