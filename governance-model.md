description: How decisions are made within BrainGlobe

# Governance model

## Aims

The aim of this page is to outline how decisions are made within the BrainGlobe project. BrainGlobe is intended as a community project, and so anyone with an interest in using or developing these tools can contribute. Equally, these tools represent a large amount of work from many developers and form an important part of many users' work. The governance model exists to establish a streamlined and effective decision making process to guide future developments.

## Individual roles and responsibilities

All interested users fall into \(at least\) one of three groups, with different levels of responsibility for the project:

### Users and contributors

Anybody with an interest any part of the BrainGlobe project can contribute to the project in ways such as:

* Filing issues on the [GitHub](https://github.com/brainglobe) page of the relevant repository
* Submitting a pull request on the [GitHub](https://github.com/brainglobe) page of the relevant repository
* Asking or answering questions on the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/brainglobe) channels
* Reviewing pull requests
* Discussing the project in open issues, pull requests, or any other channel.

**These users may contribute in any way they see fit.**

### Core developers

Core developers are a group of users who take responsibility for the development and maintenance of the "core" BrainGlobe repositories \(e.g. the [Atlas API](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-atlasapi)\). These developers will have additional rights to the repository \(e.g. merge pull requests\) and will vote on any changes to the project. The list of core developers is currently as follows:

* [Lugi Petrucco](https://github.com/vigji)
* [Federico Claudi](https://github.com/FedeClaudi)
* [Adam Tyson](https://github.com/adamltyson)   

Any interested party can join the core developers, based on the informal criteria of "a substantial contribution to BrainGlobe core repositories". Election will require a simple vote of existing core developers. 

**Core developers are expected to aim to contribute regularly to the code bases \(e.g. comments, issues, pull requests\), attend as many meetings as possible, and vote upon any major changes to the project.** 

### Non-core developers

Any BrainGlobe repositories that are not deemed to be central to all BrainGlobe work \(e.g. [cellfinder](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder) or [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender)\), will be governed independently of this model. 

**The developers on non-core repositories are expected to contribute to the core repositories, and ensure compatibility and interoperability with other BrainGlobe tools as far as possible.**

### Steering committee

There exists a group of developers, separate to the core developers that exists for long-term decisions \(e.g. funding acquisition\) and if the core developers cannot reach a majority decision in any case. New members can be added based on a simple vote by the steering committee, based on the criteria of “substantial contributions to a number of BrainGlobe tools over a long period of time \(e.g. &gt; 1yr\)”. It is expected that the vast majority of decisions are made by the core developers, and not by the steering committee. The steering committee is currently as follows:

* [Lugi Petrucco](https://github.com/vigji)
* [Federico Claudi](https://github.com/FedeClaudi)
* [Adam Tyson](https://github.com/adamltyson)   

**The steering committee are expected to be core developers, and additionally discuss and vote upon the long-term direction of the project.**
