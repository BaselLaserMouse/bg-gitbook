# BG-brainrender-GUI

`bg-brainrender-GUI` is a `pyqt5` based GUI built around [`brainrender`](https://docs.brainrender.info/).

The goal of this program is to provide an easy to use graphical interface for `brainrender`, enabling the creation of 3d anatomical renderings with minimal coding requirements. Because `brainrender` is fully integrated with [`BG-AtlasAPI`](../bg-atlasapi/introduction.md), `bg-brainrender-GUI` can be used to visualize atlases supported by brainglobe. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently `bg-brainrender-gui` only supports some of `brainrender`'s core functionality, but we are happy to extend `bg-brainrender-gui` should there be interest in this.
{% endhint %}
