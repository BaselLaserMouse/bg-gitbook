# Tutorial

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Still a work in progress.**
{% endhint %}

Although cellfinder is designed to be easy to install and use, if you're coming to it with fresh eyes, it's not always clear where to start. We provide an example brain to get you started, and also to illustrate how to play with the parameters to better suit your data.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The test dataset is large** \(~250GB\). It is recommended that you try this tutorial out on the fastest machine you have, with the fastest hard drive possible \(ideally SSD\) and an NVIDIA GPU. See [System requirements](../installation/system-requirements.md) for more details.
{% endhint %}

## Tutorial

The tutorial is quite long, and is split into a number of sections. Please be aware that downloading the data, and running cellfinder may take a long time \(e.g. overnight x2\) if you don't have access to a particularly high-powered computer, or fast network connection.

Please go through the following sections in order:

* [Setting up](setting-up.md)
* [Running cellfinder](running-cellfinder.md)
* [Visualising the results](visualising-the-results.md)
* [Exploring the numerical results](exploring-the-numerical-results.md)
* [Visualising your data in brainrender](visualising-your-data-in-brainrender.md)
