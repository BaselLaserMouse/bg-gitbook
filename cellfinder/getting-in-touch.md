# Getting in touch

cellfinder is still at an early stage, so we know that there will be bugs, and features that you might want that we haven't added yet.

There are two main sources of help. These are both public, because if you have an issue, there's likely plenty more people who come across the same problem.

## General guidance (help forum)

If you want general help with cellfinder (or any other BrainGlobe software), best practices etc, an error message you don't understand, please use the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc). Please tag your question with both `brainglobe` and the name of the tool you're using (e.g. `cellfinder`).
